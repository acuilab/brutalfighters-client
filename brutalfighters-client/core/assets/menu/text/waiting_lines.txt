We are almost there!
Perhaps invite some friends?
Do you like the music?
We better meet each other :)
It's like waiting for a train!
Here get some lemonade!
You will love this game, promise!
Isn't it a beautiful logo?
This game was written in Java
I was joking, we almost here..
This is not a loading screen!
Prepare yourself!
Are you the true fighter?
Be respectful, yet strong!
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I am thinking the same thing!
We shall debug this forever!
Good game is incoming!
Be sportsman like, yet brutal!
Sign here please
We got a party for you!
This game has bunch of players!
Building some bridges..
Removing cool downs..
Killing immortal monsters..
No noobs here, just joking!
Doge is real.
Chopping off trees..
Climbing the highest mountain..
No ads here, never
Brutal Fighters is open source!
It's all about this screen!
The silence before the storm..
Nothing stops this train
Java isn't just a great coffee
Booleans also have opinions!
Painting the flag..
It's all in your head.
Sometime..maybe..now!
Constructive feedback incoming?
You should smile more! :)
Nothing of importance here!
I heard you want to be a pro?
Only one guy is behind this game
Are expecting to survive out there?
Don't mind the last line..
Who said that? Not me!
Take it as a journey!
Take it as an amazing adventure!
Why a man couldn't juggle?
You will get stronger each game!
You never heard it from me!
10/10 Would read again.
Wait! I've got a better line:
